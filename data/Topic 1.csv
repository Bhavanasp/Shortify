44155727.0,Merge two lists of intervals with priority for one list,"Your naive method sounds very reasonable; I think the time complexity of it is O(NM), where N is the number of intervals you're trying to resolve, and M is the the range over which you're trying to resolve them.  The difficulty you might have is that you also have space complexity of O(M), which might use up a fair bit of memory.Here's a method for merging without building a ""master list"", which may be faster; because it treats intervals as objects, complexity is no longer tied to M.I'll represent an interval (or list of intervals) as a set of tuples (a,b,p), each of which indicates the time points from a to b, inclusively, with the integer priority p (W can be 1, and S can be 2).  In each interval, it must be the case that a < b.  Higher priorities are preferred.We need a predicate to define the overlap between two intervals:When we find overlaps, we need to resolve them.  This method takes care of that, respecting priority:Finally, merge_intervals takes an iterable of intervals and joins them together until there are no more overlaps:I think this has worst-case time complexity of O(N^4), although the average case should be fast.  In any case, you may want to time this solution against your simpler method, to see what works better for your problem.As far as I can see, my merge_intervals works for your examples:To cover the case with blank (B) intervals, simply add another interval tuple which covers the whole range with priority 0: (1, M, 0):",1.0,3.7670115926944976
50297176.0,Merge large images on disk,"pyvips can do exactly what you want very quickly and efficiently. For example:The access=""sequential"" option tells pyvips that you want to stream the image. It will only load pixels on demand as it generates output, so you can merge enormous images using only a little memory. The arrayjoin operator joins an array of images into a grid across tiles across. It has quite a few layout options: you can specify borders, overlaps, background, centring behaviour and so on.I can run it like this:So it joined 100 JPG images to make a 14,000 x 20,000 pixel mosaic in about 2.5s on this laptop, and from watching top, needed about 300mb of memory. I've used it to join over 30,000 images into a single file, and it would go higher. I've made images of over 300,000 by 300,000 pixels.The pyvips equivalent of PIL's paste is insert. You could use that too, though it won't work so well for very large numbers of images. There's also a command-line interface, so you could just enter:To join up a large set of JPG images.",1.0,3.474598784189162
46362972.0,Merge list of lists in python 3,"I managed to do what you intended by changing your format. I convert all your sublists into dict with the key user.Because it easier to merge dict and the order of user in your sublists doesn't matter.The last steps is to iterate over the merged dict of list1 and list2 and do your special operation. As I understood, is to take the before last number of list1 and merge it with list2. Then you recreate your desired sublist.Output:EDITIt seems I make a mistake and your list1 have to check all the content of list2, in that case you should make a dict of list2 first and apply your specific condition after. eg:output:Note: we can get rid of defaultdict since the same key is not being to be added twice.",1.0,3.4214305719947777
14008075.0,How to merge many to many relations from one db session to another with SQLAlchemy?,"First off, don't feel bad as I had to test this to see why it doesn't work, and I wrote the thing.The merge() use case is one where you're taking some kind of in-application data, either from an offline cache or some locally modified structure, and moving it into a new Session.   merge() is mostly about merging changes, so when it sees attributes that have no ""change"", it assumes no special work is needed.   So it skips unloaded relationships.  If it did follow unloaded relationships, the merge process would become a very slow and burdensome operation as it traverses the full graph of relationships loading everything recursively, potentially loading a significant portion of the database into memory for a highly interlinked schema.  The ""copy from one database to another"" use case here was not anticipated.the data does go in if you just make sure all those edges are loaded ahead of time, here's a demo.   the default cascade is ""save-update, merge"" also so you don't have to specify that.",1.0,3.404648885335332

36683756.0,Merge sort a list of words,As you identified the problem is that merge_sort has no way of knowing the basis of sorting. You could change merge_sort to take in an additional parameter that returns the key for each element in the sequence just like sorted does:Then change the comparison to call passed function instead of comparing elements directly:And finally pass key to recursive calls:With these changes it will work as you expect:One thing to note though is that results are not identical with sorted since merge_sort is not stable:,1.0,2.9713436119712435
60330020.0,Merge two Pandas data frames on overlapping segments,"Create a conditional to find if there is an overlap between the two frames, create new columns based on the conditionals, and merge, using how='outer'What I observed from the data is that if the overlap (end-start) in df_1 is greater than or equal to the overlap in df_2, then add start_data_2, otherwise, leave as is.

If you want multiple colors, use a one-line Text widget, or use a canvas with a text item. Here's a quick and dirty example using a text widget.

39250242.0,How to merge and delete nodes in networkx graph?,"If I understand correctly, you want to recursively merge the nodes until there is no overlap between the edges.
