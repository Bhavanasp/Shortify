"I believe the solution to your problem would be to use the pd.join(). After the join fill the master dataframe by looping through the joined dataframe and using the index to assing to each row:I don't have the output because I didn't build a master dataframe, but it should work",,"df_joined = ugt.join(ugh, how='outer')
