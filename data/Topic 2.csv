44155727.0,Merge two lists of intervals with priority for one list,"Your naive method sounds very reasonable; I think the time complexity of it is O(NM), where N is the number of intervals you're trying to resolve, and M is the the range over which you're trying to resolve them.  The difficulty you might have is that you also have space complexity of O(M), which might use up a fair bit of memory.Here's a method for merging without building a ""master list"", which may be faster; because it treats intervals as objects, complexity is no longer tied to M.I'll represent an interval (or list of intervals) as a set of tuples (a,b,p), each of which indicates the time points from a to b, inclusively, with the integer priority p (W can be 1, and S can be 2).  In each interval, it must be the case that a < b.  Higher priorities are preferred.We need a predicate to define the overlap between two intervals:When we find overlaps, we need to resolve them.  This method takes care of that, respecting priority:Finally, merge_intervals takes an iterable of intervals and joins them together until there are no more overlaps:I think this has worst-case time complexity of O(N^4), although the average case should be fast.  In any case, you may want to time this solution against your simpler method, to see what works better for your problem.As far as I can see, my merge_intervals works for your examples:To cover the case with blank (B) intervals, simply add another interval tuple which covers the whole range with priority 0: (1, M, 0):",1.0,4.0
50297176.0,Merge large images on disk,"pyvips can do exactly what you want very quickly and efficiently. For example:The access=""sequential"" option tells pyvips that you want to stream the image. It will only load pixels on demand as it generates output, so you can merge enormous images using only a little memory. The arrayjoin operator joins an array of images into a grid across tiles across. It has quite a few layout options: you can specify borders, overlaps, background, centring behaviour and so on.I can run it like this:So it joined 100 JPG images to make a 14,000 x 20,000 pixel mosaic in about 2.5s on this laptop, and from watching top, needed about 300mb of memory. I've used it to join over 30,000 images into a single file, and it would go higher. I've made images of over 300,000 by 300,000 pixels.The pyvips equivalent of PIL's paste is insert. You could use that too, though it won't work so well for very large numbers of images. There's also a command-line interface, so you could just enter:To join up a large set of JPG images.",1.0,3.882093892007529
14008075.0,How to merge many to many relations from one db session to another with SQLAlchemy?,"First off, don't feel bad as I had to test this to see why it doesn't work, and I wrote the thing.The merge() use case is one where you're taking some kind of in-application data, either from an offline cache or some locally modified structure, and moving it into a new Session.   merge() is mostly about merging changes, so when it sees attributes that have no ""change"", it assumes no special work is needed.   So it skips unloaded relationships.  If it did follow unloaded relationships, the merge process would become a very slow and burdensome operation as it traverses the full graph of relationships loading everything recursively, potentially loading a significant portion of the database into memory for a highly interlinked schema.  The ""copy from one database to another"" use case here was not anticipated.the data does go in if you just make sure all those edges are loaded ahead of time, here's a demo.   the default cascade is ""save-update, merge"" also so you don't have to specify that.",1.0,3.7238830260249216

1158128.0,Merge sorted lists in python,"Python standard library offers a method for it: heapq.merge.
As the documentation says, it is very similar to using itertools (but with more limitations); if you cannot live with those limitations (or if you do not use Python 2.6) you can do something like this:However, I think it has the same complexity as your own solution, although using iterators should give some quite good optimization and speed increase.",1.0,3.4147612366621973
50297176.0,Merge large images on disk,"I would suggest using the TIFF file format. Most TIFF files are striped (one or more scan lines are stored as a block on file), but it is possible to write tiled TIFF files (where the image is divided into tiles, and each is stored as an independent block on file).LibTIFF is the canonical way of reading and writing TIFF files. It has an easy way of creating a new TIFF file, and add tiles one at the time. Thus, your program can create the TIFF file, obtain one sector, write it as (one or more) tiles to the TIFF file, obtain the next sector, etc. You would have to choose your tile size to evenly divide one sector.There is a Python binding to LibTIFF called, what else, PyLibTIFF. It should allow you to follow the above model from within Python. That same repository has pure Python module to read and write TIFF files, I don't know if that is able to write TIFF files in tiles, or if it allows to write them in chunks. There are many other Python modules for reading and writing TIFF files, but most will write one matrix as a TIFF file, rather than allow you to write a file one tile at a time.",1.0,3.3336920483879475

54697379.0,How to merge two numpy array's cells containing strings?,"You didn't show linar_eq, but I can guess it is: list() applied to a string breaks it up, producing a list of characters.np.array on that list doesn't change things, and won't make grouping the characters any easier.  Stick with list operations.The two proposed answers follow different 'rules'.  One looks like it takes the characters 2 by 2, but then drops the '='.  The other drops the 'x'.  Why?Your problem is not clearly specified.  But I suspect you'd be better off using the regex mechanism to split up the original string.  It isn't a merging problem.
