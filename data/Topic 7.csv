14008075.0,How to merge many to many relations from one db session to another with SQLAlchemy?,"First off, don't feel bad as I had to test this to see why it doesn't work, and I wrote the thing.The merge() use case is one where you're taking some kind of in-application data, either from an offline cache or some locally modified structure, and moving it into a new Session.   merge() is mostly about merging changes, so when it sees attributes that have no ""change"", it assumes no special work is needed.   So it skips unloaded relationships.  If it did follow unloaded relationships, the merge process would become a very slow and burdensome operation as it traverses the full graph of relationships loading everything recursively, potentially loading a significant portion of the database into memory for a highly interlinked schema.  The ""copy from one database to another"" use case here was not anticipated.the data does go in if you just make sure all those edges are loaded ahead of time, here's a demo.   the default cascade is ""save-update, merge"" also so you don't have to specify that.",1.0,3.9381569478486873
46362972.0,Merge list of lists in python 3,"I managed to do what you intended by changing your format. I convert all your sublists into dict with the key user.Because it easier to merge dict and the order of user in your sublists doesn't matter.The last steps is to iterate over the merged dict of list1 and list2 and do your special operation. As I understood, is to take the before last number of list1 and merge it with list2. Then you recreate your desired sublist.Output:EDITIt seems I make a mistake and your list1 have to check all the content of list2, in that case you should make a dict of list2 first and apply your specific condition after. eg:output:Note: we can get rid of defaultdict since the same key is not being to be added twice.",1.0,3.7257037941009843
57015170.0,How to merge and split again thousands of text files?,"First of all, I assumed you've not repeated your strings correctly (like ""hi, this is an example line."" != ""hi, this is edited line."") by mistake, not on purpose (that I can't figure out).I named the accumulative file common.doc to distinct from the other .txt files in the target directory. Also, this example code implies all the files are in the same directory.And after common.doc editing:And a solution for multiline text (merging stays with .strip() removed on content writing), not suitable for hundreds of thousands of files tho...",1.0,3.527432356790933
47667379.0,how to merge two html files through tornado,"You'll have to learn how templating works.

Let pandas do that for you (it uses BeautifulSoup under the hood).
